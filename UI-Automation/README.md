2. **Open a browser** and navigate to the designated RPA challenge website.
3. **Search** for the entered movie title.
4. **Scrape** the movie description from the result page.
5. **Open Notepad** and write the extracted description.
6. **Save** the Notepad file with the name of the movie (e.g., `Avengers.txt`).

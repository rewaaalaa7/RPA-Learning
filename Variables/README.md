# Exploring Variables in UiPath

This project demonstrates how to use and manipulate variables in UiPath Studio through a simple example that simulates a user login message.

## Objective

To explore:
- Different variable types in UiPath (String, Boolean, DateTime, etc.)
- How to assign values
- How to concatenate strings to form dynamic messages

## What the Project Does

The project creates a message using a **username** variable and appends a custom login message.

### Example:
If the `username` variable is set to `Rewaa`, the output will be: Rewaa is logged in

## How to Run

1. Open `Main.xaml` in UiPath Studio.
2. Make sure dependencies are restored.
3. Run the workflow.
4. A message box will show the login message based on the value of `username`.
